The aim of the **CHOMPS** workshop is to find ways to mitigate one of major the hurdles that currently prevent the adoption of Large Language Models in real-world scenarios: namely, their tendency to hallucinate, i.e., produce unsupported and unverifiable text that sounds deceptively plausible. 

The workshop will explore **hallucination mitigation** in practical situations, where this mitigation is crucial: in particular,  precision-critical applications (such as those in the medical, legal and biotech domains), as well as multilingual settings (given the lack of resources available to reproduce what can be done for English in other linguistic contexts). In practice, we intend to invite works of the following (not exclusive) list of topics:

- Metrics, benchmarks and tools for hallucination detection; 

- Factuality challenges in mission critical & domain-specific (e.g., medical, legal, biotech) and their consequences on societal, engineering and practical levels;

- Mitigation strategies during inference or model training; 

- Studies of hallucinatory and confabulatory behaviors of LLMS in cross-lingual and multilingual scenarios; 

- Confabulations in language & multimodal (vision, text, speech) models.

- Perspectives and case studies from other disciplines
